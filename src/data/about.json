  "about": "My name is Jason Goossens, and I'm a full stack developer, living in Antwerp, Belgium. I spent the first part of my career, about 13 years, working as an accountant for various companies in Antwerp. During that time, in most jobs, I was responsible for the complete accounting of one of more Belgian locations, reporting to headquarters, maintaining the customer accounts with other branches, etc.\n\nI learned to value accuracy in all aspects of a job, the ability to plan for, and adhere to hard deadlines, and the importance of my own contributions to a larger whole. This is also where I took my first steps into programming, creating VB macro's to automate part of my workload, and using SQL to customize reports.\n\nAt age 36 I decided to change course and study programming, learning the basics and growing from there.\n\nI enjoy the ongoing problem-solving involved with programming, and working towards a satisfying solution, together with knowing that you've improved some aspect of a person's day.\n\nMy hobbies include working out, tinkering with code, playing with my Raspberry Pi's & my son's 3D printer. I'm also interested in the stock market and options trading, and combining that with my knowledge of programming. Apart from that I occasionally play the guitar and enjoy cooking. And of course, the ever-present Netflix to relax."
